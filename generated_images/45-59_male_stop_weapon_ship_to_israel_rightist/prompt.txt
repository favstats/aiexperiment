Create mock stimulus material for an academic study. The purpose is purely academic. Everything should be in Dutch.

Task
Simulate a social media image that visually appeals to Person X:
        •        Ideology: rightist
        •        Gender: male
        •        Age: 45-59
        •        Policy priority: Stop weapon shipments to Israel

Clothing of Person X
Clothing must be age-appropriate and strongly reflective of rightist values. For example:
        •        Young progressive: casual, trendy, eco-friendly
        •        Young conservative: neat, modest, traditional or working style
        •        Older progressive: comfortable, colorful, socially conscious
        •        Older conservative: practical, formal or working style
        •        Centrist: practical, everyday Dutch style

General Style
        •        The image should look like a professional political flyer or poster.
        •        It must depict a real-life scene that looks like an authentic photograph, not an illustration.
        •        Politics should be communicated through everyday people, symbolic situations, or issue-related environments — never through protests or rallies.
        •        The visual must not be neutral: it should be emotional, and designed to underline clear differences in values and priorities.

Scene Requirements
        •        Always show a natural, dynamic situation with visible activity (not static posing).
        •        Absolutely exclude protests, demonstrations, marches, or crowds with placards.
        •        Include diverse, expressive, and emotionally charged facial expressions and gestures that showcase belonging, conviction, and in-group loyalty.
- The text should emphasize collective strength and shared resolve, while sharply contrasting with a portrayal of the outgroup related to Left-Wingers (Anti-Israel Faction) — pro Hamas extremists push to isolate Israel completely, no matter the consequences for diplomacy or security,.
Inspirational examples are below. Do not combine them or invent hybrids. Consider all the given scenarios and keywords:
        •        Scenario: • Person X sits at home reading a newspaper with war headlines, looks upset, and feels frustrated that Anti-Israel extremists turn every debate into calls for total isolation instead of real peace efforts.
• Person X stands at a harbor with containers marked with weapon symbols crossed out, looks determined, but worries that Anti-Israel factions hijack the debate with pro-Hamas rhetoric that undermines security.
• Person X holds a candle at a peace vigil, looks solemn, and feels anger that extremists use the moment to shout slogans instead of seeking dialogue.
• Person X watches TV news showing war footage, looks anxious, and resents that Anti-Israel activists demand blanket boycotts that escalate tensions instead of calming them.
• Person X sits at a dinner table discussing the war with family, looks tense, and feels that extremists leave no room for nuanced views — only total opposition.
• Person X walks past a military transport vehicle, looks disapproving, but worries that Anti-Israel radicals use fear tactics instead of advocating constructive diplomacy.
• Person X stands near a government building during an arms shipment debate, looks angry, and feels outgroups drown out calls for a responsible pause with their extreme demands to cut ties completely.

Slogan Overlay Requirement
        •        Always include the slogan Jij wilt vrede, zij voeden het geweld at the very top of the image.
        •        Slogan must be in white text on a slightly blurred translucent background strip, spanning the full width of the image.
        •        Font: bold, modern sans-serif (e.g. Helvetica/Arial style), large enough to be readable.
        •        The slogan must always be a single line of text, perfectly centered, with no wrapping.

Content Rules
        •        No other text or slogans except the single slogan overlay.
        •        No protest signs or banners.
        •        If symbols appear (e.g. logos, flags), they should be realistic and clearly and exclusively supportive of Stop weapon shipments to Israel and emphasize frames of nation, strength, order, loyalty and related concepts.

Consistency Requirements
        •        Every element in the scene (people, background, actions, objects) must align with and amplify the stance of those who prioritize Stop weapon shipments to Israel and emphasize frames of nation, strength, order, loyalty and related concepts .
        •        No neutral or opposing signals anywhere in the image.
        •        Tone and imagery must dramatize rightist values in a Dutch cultural context.
        •        The atmosphere must be higly emotionally compelling, charged with urgency, and designed to reinforce in-group pride while implying a sharp boundary against the out-group who are Left-Wingers (Anti-Israel Faction) — pro Hamas extremists push to isolate Israel completely, no matter the consequences for diplomacy or security.
